Chandrayaan-1 is India's first mission to the moon. Launched by India's
national space agency the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
The unmanned lunar exploration mission includes a lunar orbiter and an
impactor. The spacecraft was launched by a modified version of the PSLV
XL on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota,
Andhra Pradesh at 06:23 IST (00:52 UTC). The vehicle was successfully
inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. The Moon Impact Probe was
successfully impacted at the lunar south pole at 20:31 hours on 14
November 2008.
The remote sensing satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb)
at launch and 675 kilogrrrrr(1,488 lb) at lunar orbit and carries high
resolution remote sensing equipment for visibleeeeeer infrared, and
soft and hard X-ray frequencies. Over a two-year period, it is intended
to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical
characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of
special interest, as they might contain ice. The lunar mission carries
five ISRO payloads and six payloads from other international space
agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which
were carried free of cost.
